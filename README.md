This is a project I'm taking as part of my Big Data in Economics Module.

Research question is primarily surrounding Cryptocurrency pricing in comparison to macroeconomic indicators.


## Data
This project retrieves data directly from public APIs (Binance, FRED, Yahoo Finance).  
To reproduce results, run the data collection scripts with your own API keys.  
Data files (`.csv`) are excluded from version control for size and reproducibility reasons.
